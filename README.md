# uni-math

(I dunno how one writes in markdown) (and I don't know how to use english)  
So this is a totally unstructured sum of all Documents I need for my math studies. 
So my idea behind the stucture was  
- math
    - ana
        - ana I 
            - script
            - exercise sheets
        - (ana II)
        - ...
    - lina
        - lina I
            - script
            - exercise sheets
        - ...

- computer science
    - concepts of computer science (Konzepte der Informatik)
        - lecture slides
        - excercise sheets
    - programming course
        - nothing important
    - rsn (Rechnersysteme und -netze)
        - ...

- physics
    - IK  
        - IK I
            - script (it's weird don't be surprised)  
            - exercise sheets
  
and don't look into the .tex or .cls files I'm afraid that they are very ugly
